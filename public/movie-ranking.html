<h3>Intestellar</h3>
<p>Just incredible visual, gotta watch in movie theaters. A bit long though, I almost peed myself in the movie theater</p>
<h3>Her</h3>
<p>Another great Sci-fi movie, feels like we are getting closer to that point now that we got ChatGPT...</p>
<h3>Porco Rosso</h3>
<p>Funny, beautiful story, amazing music. Can't ask for anything more from Miyosaki!</p>
